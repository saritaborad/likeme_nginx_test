=> steps to add ci-cd on server 

=> check for id_rsa and id_rsa.pub key exist or not 
if not
1) generate ssh key 
=> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
=> ls ~/.ssh/
=> it will generate id_rsa and id_rsa.pub key 

2) add private key in git inside directory
 => setting => secrete and variable => actions => new repository secret 

=> get key from server  
=> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
=> copy content and add it 
=> put whole key with -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY----- <key> -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

3) add deploy key 
 => setting => deploy keys => add deploy key 

 => get key from server 
 => cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
 => copy content and add it with any name

4) look for ssh agent exists or not 
ssh-add -l
if not add it
=> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

5)  add pub key in authorized_keys
=> cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
=> chmod 700 ~/.ssh/
=> chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

6)  host key of pikso.in to the known_hosts
=> ssh-keyscan -t rsa pikso.in >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

7) test SSH connection 
=> ssh -T git@github.com


8) add yml file 
=> in git repo => actions tab => create yml file 

6) create deploy.sh file on server
